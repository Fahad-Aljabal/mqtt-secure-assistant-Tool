# MQTT Secure Assistant Tool

This repository contains the source code for the **MQTT Secure Assistant Tool**, developed as part of MSc dissertation project.

The tool provides a GUI-based assistant for configuring the Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker securely by default. It automates:
- TLS certificate generation or import
- User creation with password policy enforcement
- ACL file management for topic-level access control
- Configuration file generation with secure defaults
- Structured logging and lightweight alerting
